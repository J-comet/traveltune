"theme_hangang_content" = "The lower Han River region in Korea has a rich history as a cultural center and a crucial transportation route to China during the Three Kingdoms period. After Seoul became the capital during the Joseon Dynasty, it remained important for water transportation. Although its transportation role declined due to dam construction for flood control and hydroelectric power, it still plays a significant role in supplying water to the metropolitan area for domestic and industrial use.";

"theme_museum_content" = "In the past, the role of museums was primarily limited to preserving and displaying exhibits for visitors to see. However, today, museums have transformed into spaces where visitors can experience exhibition-related programs, take a break, and enjoy a wide range of content.";
"theme_temple_content" = "The structures within a temple hold individual meanings. Starting with the Iljumun Gate, the temple's layout gradually leads from the secular world to the path of enlightenment. Traditional Korean temple architecture is centered around a pagoda. The names of the buildings vary according to the Buddha enshrined within them.";
"theme_bukchon_content" = "Bukchon Hanok Village is a place where the yangban (nobility) class has lived for over 600 years. Even today, actual residents inhabit the village and preserve its hanok (traditional Korean house) architecture. Bukchon Hanok Village boasts important historical assets, and its streets with the beauty of hanoks stand out, making it a charming and popular tourist destination.";
